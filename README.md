# Flask updates

It's been a couple of years since using Flask. In the meantime many things
have changed and. Not only on Flask, but on Python itself and many helpful
libaries have been released.

In this repo I am adopting the basic Flask tutorial and changing it by trying
to touch all the new goodies mentioned above. 

Some attention points:

- SQL Alchemy database layer.
- Pydantic settings management.
- Pre-commit hooks
- Pytest automated testing.
